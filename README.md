## Overview of the Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to look into the predicted "silver tsunami" (large number of people retiring) for the company, and make a data driven decison on how to prepare for it.

## Results:

Building the inital table to get the total number of people we are expecting to retire soon. We can see that 41,380 is the total number of people who are becoming eligible to retire. This data was made in the "Retirement Info" table.

I was also able to grab each role that will become vacant, and added this information in the "Retirement Titles" table.

Needing a better understanding of which departments may be effected more, I was able to showcase, by department, the number of roles that may become vacant soon. This data was added into the "Retirement By Dept" table.

Finally, I was able to check the number of people who would be elibilble to move into the Mentorship Program. This was added into the "Mentorship Eligibility" table.
